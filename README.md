# GaussianPlume
"GaussianPlume" is a project to visualize effect of toxic release in any area through Gaussian dispersion model.
The simulation is available at http://GaussianPlume.github.io/?wd=0/ws=5/Q=10000/lat=23/lon=91.3 where
wd is wind direction, ws is wind speed, Q is amount of material released and lat,lon are latitude and longitude respectively.
One can vary the values of wd,ws,Q,lat and lon according to their need.

Assumptions:
The following assumptions were used to make the simulation.

1. 
2.
3.
4.
